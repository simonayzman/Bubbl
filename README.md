Get out of your echo chamber! Facebook tends to serve content to you that you probably already agree with, unless you explicitly follow or like other news sources. See how the same topic gets covered across different news outlets, across the political spectrum. Pop your bubble!

## tldr;

Want to take the app for a spin? Here is a quick start guide:

```
git clone https://github.com/simonayzman/Bubbl.git
cd Bubbl
yarn install
react-native run-ios
```

## Functionality

Upon seeing an article in your feed, you can take the following actions:

* **Tap the story** -> This takes you to the web page for the article.
* **Long press the news outlet** -> This "flips" the story, showing an article from a news outlet on the opposite end of the political spectrum.
* **Long press the story** -> This opens a carousel of articles by many news outlets, across the political spectrum, reporting on a similar topic. It also visually pinpoints where the media companies falls on the political spectrum.

## Credits

This project was theorized, prototyped, and built at the 2017 Facebook Journalism Project Hackathon in NYC. All images that appear to be Facebook's are indeed owned by Facebook. Content is pulled from CrowdTangle. Scores for liberalism/conservatism are based on "Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Online News Consumption" by Seth Flaxman, Sharad Goel, and Justin M. Rao.
